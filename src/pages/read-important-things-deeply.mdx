I should really take the advice from [Tris's Elaborate Coping Mechanisms video](https://youtu.be/XUZ9VATeF_4?t=561) and use RSS. I've stopped using the youtube main page about a month ago, so now I have to check everywhere manually.

When I find an article I want to read, I'm likely to put it into `inbox` and forget about it.

Also, some takeaways from [TheMagicalIC's article on that video](https://sudo-nano.github.io/posts/Coping-Mechanisms/#f-o-c-u-s):
- Either read the article fully or don't read it at all, don't stop at the headline or the first few paragraphs.
- Read at a consistent time and place, make it a habit.

The last point, for me, is about *the inbox* inside my vault which I KEEP FORGETTING ABOUT!
