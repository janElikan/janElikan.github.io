Discord and other apps that try to capture the screen may not work on wayland, use this kde project to fix them.

If I understand correctly, it needs an [xdg-portal](/xdg-portal), here's what I use on [nixos](/nixos) for [sway](/sway):
```nix
xdg.portal.enable = true
xdg.portal.wlr.enable = true
```

Then you just install xwaylandvideobridge, run it in the background and it handles screencap.
