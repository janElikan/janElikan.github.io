level 1 runs on *bare metal*. A level-1 hypervisor is a minimal operating system with the hyprevisor software on top. Its pro is that it requires little resources for the host OS.

The most popular options are:
- [proxmox](proxmox)
- [xcp-ng](xcp-ng)
- [esxi](esxi)

Some NAS systems (like TrueNas Scale) also support running VMs.

lvel 2 hypervisors are software that you install *on top* of your primary OS.

Which one you install is largely dependent on which host OS you're running:
- [virtualbox](virtualbox) works on anything, but it's the slowest one
- [hyper-v](hyper-v) is the windows one, and
- [qemu](qemu) is the best choice for anything else
