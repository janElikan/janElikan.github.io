Making a custom stream function doesn't solve anything beacuse I need to fetch data from html and not js anyway.

I've read [a github discussion about this](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/discussions/7145) again, I've *overlooked the asset protocol*. [The docs](https://v2.tauri.app/reference/javascript/api/namespacecore/#convertfilesrc) say that I need to patch csp.
