Dts are going to be the dotfiles and provisioning scripts for my devices (2 currently).

I need to work on the machine I'm writing this on, so I can't reinstall the system on it now. What I can do is either dual-boot or make a VM.

Somehow I forgot that I can just make a VM until like 2 days ago. I have 32 gigs of RAM, so I can even leave it running in the background.

So yeah, I'll make a [nixos](nixos) [virtual-machine](virtual-machine) and write my dotfiles on that.

I've set up the machine and installed neovim on it. This note will be uploaded after the config, but the dates in the frontmatter are correct.

~~Tomorrow~~ On 2024-06-18 I'll start writing the actual dotfiles.

The machine set up using [quickemu](quickemu), it's in `~/vms/nixos-unstable-gnome.conf` although it doesn't use gnome. I'll probably rename it later.

I've set up a flake in it and installed [home-manager](home-manager). That works well. What doesn't is [sway](sway), I can't yet figure out how to start it on [quickemu](quickemu).

I'm creating a branch inside [dots](dots) for gnome. I need to figure out how to get screen capture working on wayland, so until then...

It's in a usable state! I have added it

Requirements for each machine:
- all *perephirals must be wired*
- *no remote access* except for the server
- *no closed-source services* that have *full access to hardware* (e.g. google assistant)
  - exception: phone vendor's kernel
- all devices can be *set up* either fully or semi-*automatically* using the [dots repo](https://github.com/janElikan/dots) (i.e. no snowflakes)
- the *OS* has to be able to *heal itself* to a point, no system reinstalls

Data:
- the vault is as public/transparent as possible
- all important data is stored in one directory
- that directory is synced across all devices
- compressed, encrypted and backed up weekly

Physical machines:
- workstation <span class="sitelen-pona">ilo&sona suli</span>
- mobile computer <span class="sitelen-pona">ilo&sona tawa</span>
- server, optional

Virtual machines:
- can follow the requirements if they are trusted
- are considered temporary, disposable if they don't

Containers are not treated as machines and do not have to follow these.
