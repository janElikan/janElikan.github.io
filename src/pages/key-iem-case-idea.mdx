Gear:
- keyboard: [cantor-remix](https://github.com/nilokr/cantor-remix)
- iem: [chu 2](https://moondroplab.com/en/products/chu-ii)
- some cables

I want a hard case for them.

I've been experimenting with different layout options in [excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com), so far I like this one best because it's pretty compact:
`my website doesn't asset support yet ![[case-layout.svg]]`

And I thought I'd document the whole thing.
