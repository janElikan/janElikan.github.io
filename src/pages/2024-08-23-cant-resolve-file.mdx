So I told the backend to download files into `/tmp/downloads` and it does. The problem is that [tauri](/tauri) does not give the frontend implicit filesystem access or network access, which honestly makes a lot of sense.

Anyway, this prompts me to work on storage and now I'll start making it remember the feeds. Since everything is SERDE anyway, that should be easy!
