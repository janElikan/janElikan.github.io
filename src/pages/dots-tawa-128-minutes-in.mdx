When I started refactoring *dots* for *nix-on-droid*, I thought half of the `configuration.nix` will be shared between both devices. Well no, it won't. I'm not even entirely sure that the package versions will be the same, as <span class="sitelen-pona">ilo&sona tawa</span> is currently running nixpkgs 24.05.

I also have to switch away from the catppuccin nix module, as it uses a quite few things that simply do not exist on non-nixos systems.

One thing I'm extremely happy about, though! It *doesn't feel like a phone*, like an <span class="sitelen-pona">ilo&toki</span>, it's a <span class="sitelen-pona">ilo&sona tawa</span>, a *mobile computer*.
