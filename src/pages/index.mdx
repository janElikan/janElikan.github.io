Hello, world! My name is jan Elikan.

This website is built from my working [obsidian](/obsidian) vault. Navigation is entirely based on links because the vault is a [zettelkasten](/zettelkasten) system. You may find that some notes are pretty long with horizontal lines separating their sections, these are the source notes. My [generator](https://github.com/janElikan/site-builder) concatenates all related main notes into them. The main notes can also be linked to standalone, try clicking on the name of one.

If you find an error anywhere, please [let me know](/contact)!
