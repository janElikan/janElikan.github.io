*reqwest* is the rust's most popular HTTP client:
```toml
# add to Cargo.toml
reqwest = {
    version = "0.12.5",
    features = ["rustls-tls", "json"], # don't use OS's openssl
    default-features = false,
}
```
```rust
let body = reqwest::get("https://example.com")
    .await?
    .text()
    .await()?;

let response = reqwest::Client::new()
    .post("http://httpbin.org/post")
    .json(&some_hashmap_here)
    .send()
    .await?;
```
