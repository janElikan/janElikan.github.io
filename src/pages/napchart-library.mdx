I was trying to find the source code for [napchart.com](napchart.com), but turns out it exists as a library!

You can `npm install` and then use it like this:
```html
<div class="wrapper">
  <canvas id="napchart" />
</div>

<script>
  import Napchart from "napchart";

  const canvas = document.getElementById("napchart");
  const chart = Napchart.init(canvas.getContext('2d'), {
    elements: [
      {
        start: 720,
        end: 790,
        text: "test",
        color: "#89b4fa",
      },
    ]
  }, {
    background: "#1e1e2e",
    fontColor: "#cdd6f4",
  })
</script>
```
