Today I've attempted to go through the [official course on android basics](https://developer.android.com/courses/android-basics-compose/course), but it's...

It's been very slow as it's made for absolute beginners in programming. I'm now switching to the [compose course](https://developer.android.com/courses/jetpack-compose/course).

*Android Studio* is available in `nixpkgs`. You should also set `programs.adb.enable = true;`.

If you're using an impermanent system, make sure to make these locations *persistent*:
- `~/Android` for the SDK
- `~/.android` for the debug bridge
- `~/.java`
- `~/.gradle` for the toolchains
- `~/.config/Google` for telemetry, I guess?

If you're getting an *emulator*, note that *android 14* is called *UpsideDownCake*.

My notes on kotlin (I've never used it before):
- number types are done properly, integer != float
- typenames are capitalized (e.g., `Int`, `String`)
- `var` is mutable, `val` is immutable
- inserting a variable into string (like `{name}` in rust/py or `${name}` in js) is `$name`
