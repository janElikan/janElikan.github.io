Okay I've spent way to long formatting links. What I *should* be focusing on is *CONCATENATING* all the *MAIN* notes *into* the *SOURCE* note. Oh, except if they're nested.

- interpret the source note as a vector of links
- open each note that matches the linked one
- non-recursively dump its body into a buffer
- replace the current note's body with that buffer

Looks simple enough!
