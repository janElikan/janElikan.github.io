I've tried to use the [rust-rss-crate](/rust-rss-crate) for the project because it's the only one I've heared of. Everything worked fine until I *tried adding more feeds*. I tested it with [fasterthanlime's feed](https://fasterthanli.me/index.xml) and [namtao's youtube feed](https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCMHZ1P2iYimObhtHKfPz7gw). The library complained that the feeds didn't have a correct rss version.

So now I'm rewriting the entire thing (which is thankfully very small, so it's not a big deal) to use [feed-rs](/feed-rs).
