Directory scanning done! Now onto links!

Links need to be converted into commonmark. Since the structure is flat, I can just `.find` a note that either has a matching name or a matching alias.

Sidenote: I *love* clippy!

`Let's see if[[this]]counts as a link. It does. So everything in [[brackets]] is a link, whitespaces are ign[[o]]red.` Wait, codeblocks aren't!
