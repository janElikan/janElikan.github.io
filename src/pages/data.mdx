is a [zettelkasten](/zettelkasten)-based system I now use. I'm transitioning from fewer longer notes to this.

Note properties (stuff added on top of [zettelkasten](/zettelkasten)):
- `source: string`, or where I took the idea from
- `scope: public | sensitive | private`, whether or not my blog generator should include this when rendering
~~- `parent: string` link to the parent note (for building threads)~~

Eventually I plan to transition this system to toki pona, and rename it to `sona`. This should make it *even simpler*.
