Here's where I'm going to draw a distinction going forward:
- a *device* is a physical piece of hardware, whereas
- a *machine* (<span class="sitelen-pona">ilo sona kon</span>) is its OS and configuration

A machine can be transfered between hosts, duplicated or whatever. A *machine* does not exist in meatspace, only a device does.

The naming is bad, I know. If you have any ideas about that, please [let me know](/contact)!
