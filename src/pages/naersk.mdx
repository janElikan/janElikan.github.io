is a tool for building rust programs on nix.

The easiest way to *start* is with a flake template:
```shell
> nix flake init -t github:nix-community/naersk`
```

Usage:
```nix
naersk.buildPackage {
  src = ./.; # required

  buildInputs = []; # native packages to build the app
  doDoc = false; # build documentation
  CARGO_ENV_VAR = "test";
}
```

`buildPackage` reads `Cargo.lock` and `Cargo.toml`, fetches dependencies and returns a [[nix-derivation]].

You can also overwrite toolchains using:
```nix
naersk' = naersk.lib.${system}.override {
  cargo = toolchain;
  rustc = toolchain;
};
```
