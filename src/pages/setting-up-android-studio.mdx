*Android Studio* is available in `nixpkgs`. You should also set `programs.adb.enable = true;`.

If you're using an impermanent system, make sure to make these locations *persistent*:
- `~/Android` for the SDK
- `~/.android` for the debug bridge
- `~/.java`
- `~/.gradle` for the toolchains
- `~/.config/Google` for telemetry, I guess?

If you're getting an *emulator*, note that *android 14* is called *UpsideDownCake*.
