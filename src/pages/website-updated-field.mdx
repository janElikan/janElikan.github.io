My notes used to have an *updated* field storing an ISO 8601 timestamp. Then I recreated `.obsidian` and forgot to update the config of a plugin I use for that. So now it's called *modified*. Naturally, I forgot about this until the [website](/website) builder prototype reported on my notes not having a *modified* field. Yeah...
