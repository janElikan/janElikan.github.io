*Polyphasic sleep* is the idea that if you sleep *more often* during a 24-hour period, you need *less overall sleep*.

*Segmented* is, perhaps, the oldest polyphasic schedule. It was the *default before the industrial revolution*.

The total amount of sleep is 7 hours:
- `22:00` through `01:30`, consists almost entirely of [deep sleep](/deep sleep)
- `04:30` through `08:00`, is [rem](/rem)

You can move it around a bit, just make sure that the gap is *longer than 3 hours*, the first period includes the [sws](/sws) peak, and the second one the [rem](/rem) peak.
