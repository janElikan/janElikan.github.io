Pausing the project indefinitely.

Also I just realized that you're reading this without the context of the 3d model because I didn't end up uploading it, so... Sorry...

You know what, I'm excluding this project from the public scope for now. It's going right into inbox. Well, the source note is, these are still accessible. If you're reading this, then you're either on github or I have restored the project. I *want* to restore the project. Not now though. *Eventually*

Oh no wait, I'll leave it public. Nothing links to it anyway. I've creted a new note to remind myself though.
