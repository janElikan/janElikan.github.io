About every half a year I get someone asking me to connect a few old hard drives to the network and they don't want to buy anything and they don't want redundancy. I've built like 3 using Alpine linux, which is nice and light, but also very manual.

Going to fork the dots repo and make a machine template that automatically mounts all drives and samba-shares them. No UI, no RAID support no nothing. Just that. Stupid simple. No install either, just a live USB.

I'll test it in a [virtual-machine](/virtual-machine) (why would I ever build hardware when [machines](/device-vs-machine) are portable and I can borrow hardware from an existing device)

You can *make* a custom NixOS-based *system* by creating a [nix-flake](/nix-flake) like this:
```nix
{
  description = "Minimal Nixos Disk";
  inputs.nixos.url = "nixpkgs/24.05";

  outputs = { self, nixos }: {
    nixosConfigurations.iso = nixos.lib.nixosSystem {
      system = "x86_64-linux";
      modules = [
        "${nixos}/nixos/modules/installer/cd-dvd/installation-cd-minimal.nix"
        ./configuration.nix
      ];
    };
  };
}
```
```nix
{ config, pkgs, lib, ... }:

{
    networking.useNetworkd = true; # auto-configure networks
    networking.firewall.enable = false;
    systemd.network.wait-online.enable = true;
    networking.hostName = "mnd";

    environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
        vim
        tmux
        htop
        strace
    ];

    system.stateVersion = "24.05";
}
```
```shell
> git init
> git add flake.nix
> nix build .#nixosConfigurations.iso.config.system.build.isoImage
> ls result/iso
```

This can be useful for appliances, for example:
```nix
# in configuration.nix

services.getty.autologinUser = "admin";
security.sudo.wheelNeedsPassword = false;

users.mutableUsers = false;
users.users.admin = {
  description = "Appliance administrator";
  isNormalUser = true;
  extraGroups = [ "wheel" ];
  createHome = true;
  initialPassword = "hunter2";
};
```

*I couldn't get this to work:*

*AutoFS* is a service that automatically mounts removable media and network shares.

It's *configured* using `/etc/autofs/auto.master` (or `services.autofs.autoMaster` on NixOS):
```text
# mountpoint    device_type    --timeout=0 (to never unmount)
/mnt/usb    /etc/autofs/auto.media        --timeout=0
/mnt/nfs    /etc/autofs/auto.file_server  --timeout=60
/mnt/smb    /etc/autofs/auto.<server>     --timeout 60 --browse
```

Don't forget to launch `autofs.service`!

I've built an ISO and it doesn't do what I intended. I can't find the smb service anywhere and autofs is not configured properly. The hostname is right though. I'll look into it.

So my problems are coming from [the installer module](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/nixos/modules/installer/cd-dvd/installation-cd-minimal.nix), I'll make a system without it now.

Nope, I'm not, a lot of things depend on it.

Turns out the *disk manager service* [was disabled](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/nixos/modules/profiles/minimal.nix)!

I was wondering where the coreutils were coming from, well, they come from [this file](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/nixos-24.05/nixos/modules/config/system-path.nix).

You need to enable *services.udisks2* and then you can use these:
```shell
> udiskctl mount -b /dev/sda1
> udiskctl unmount -b /dev/sda1
```

And then you can use something like `ldm` to auto-mount disks.

The ISO *builder wasn't the problem* after all, the *autofs was*.

ldm doesn't want to work as a systemd service though. I don't know what to do...

- the SMB service is up, but
- I haven't figured out how to change the password;
- auto-mounting doesn't work,
- but today I learned about [udisks](/linux-mount-media)

The project is on hold for a few hours to a few days
