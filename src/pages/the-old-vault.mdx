There's actually a bit more to the old vault than the notes:

I've found an archived project called `dotfiles`, which says:
> You need to URGENTLY figure out your dotfiles. Store them here, it's fine. Make a quick setup script.

That took a year, but eventually I executed it exactly as planned. The dotfiles were stored in the vault, among other things:
```shell
> ls -d

Let me go through them:
- GTD
  - areas-of-focus.md
  - contexts/
  - data/ (aka reference)
  - horizons.md
  - inbox/
  - projects/
  - somedaymaybies/
- systems was the old [nixos](/nixos) config
- keys where the ssh and gpg keys were
- pass is the gnu password store's repo
- templates were for obsidian

The only thing I still haven't migrated from is the `pass` directory. It was tied to the old GPG key and had some info that I don't want anymore.
