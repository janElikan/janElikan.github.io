Zellij sends out events when something happens. If you `subscribe` to them in the `load` function, they will trigger `update`.

Most used events:

| event              | required permission    | description                                                                                      |
| ------------------ | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `ModeUpdate`       | `ReadApplicationState` | e.g., `Normal`, `Pane`, etc.                                                                     |
| `TabUpdate`        | `ReadApplicationState` | which one is active, how many are there, how many panes they contain, etc.                       |
| `PaneUpdate`       | `ReadApplicationState` | active panes, their titles and status (running/exited)                                           |
