Dts are going to be the dotfiles and provisioning scripts for my devices (2 currently).

I need to work on the machine I'm writing this on, so I can't reinstall the system on it now. What I can do is either dual-boot or make a VM.

Somehow I forgot that I can just make a VM until like 2 days ago. I have 32 gigs of RAM, so I can even leave it running in the background.

So yeah, I'll make a [nixos](nixos) [virtual-machine](virtual-machine) and write my dotfiles on that.
