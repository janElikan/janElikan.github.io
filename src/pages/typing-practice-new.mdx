In [typing-practice](/typing-practice), I used the top 5k words, now I will use 1k. It should speed up the progress and be useful enough.

~1k is also about the amount of words that I can recognize instantly, not having to think about them, it seem.

| session id | date       | duration | speed | accuracy |
| ---------- | ---------- | -------- | ----- | -------- |
| 0x0C       | 2024-08-20 | 869      | 68    | 100      |
| 0x0D       | 2024-08-21 | 715      | 61    | 99       |
| 0x0F       | 2024-08-22 | 1543     | 63    | 99       |
| 0x10       | 2024-08-23 | 492      | 67    | 100      |
| 0x11       | 2024-08-24 | 403      | 72    | 100      |
| 0x12       | 2024-08-25 | 1604     | 62    | 99       |

While I remember: a thing that helped me a lot is when I stopped backspacing one character at a time and started doing it one word at a time.
