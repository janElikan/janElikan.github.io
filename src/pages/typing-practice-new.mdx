In [typing-practice](/typing-practice), I used the top 5k words, now I will use *1k*. It should speed up the progress and be useful enough.

~1k is also about the amount of words that I can recognize instantly, not having to think about them, it seem.

Also now it's a *streak* and it shan't be broken.

While I remember: a thing that helped me a lot is when I stopped backspacing one character at a time and started doing it one word at a time.

Update: mid-0x1D I've realized that I've been running English non-1k for some time... Switched it.

It helps me a lot to look a fixed distance in front of the cursor, like the cursor is chasing my sight (if that makes any sense).
