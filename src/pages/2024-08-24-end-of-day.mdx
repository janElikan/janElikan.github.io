I've narrowed down the problem. I've changed the permissions and the files are now accessible, tested that on `feeds.json`. *I can read them from javascript, but not use them in html, as assets.* I suspect this is because the asset path is wrong, I'll try reading the source of the function that reads a file from backend to understand how to fetch it manually.

Cool, it doesn't, it `invoke`s the backend! And the backend just streams the file :/

Okay, I'll try to make it work tomorrow by making a backend function which I can fetch to get a response as an image. Except wait, can I fetch?

Or [just embedding the image as raw data into html](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20756042/how-to-display-an-image-stored-as-byte-array-in-html-javascript) probably works. At least as a short-term solution. I'll try that now.

No, wait, the permissions are malformed when I'm using the path api. That's a problem for a future me though.

What the heck, it's not the full file? It's only the first 309 lines?

[oh, yeah, right, I forgot about this...](/tauri-channels) Yeah \*sigh\*

Oh, good, no, the permissions are not malformed on the path, I just converted the path to something viewable in html.

Now I've requested it as I did before and took a look at the network tab. Don't know why I didn't do that earlier. *Anyway, I get* `The resource was requested insecurely.`, which is better than no error.

*I'm stuck on this error now*
