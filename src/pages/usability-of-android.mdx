1. it is very slow. Thanks to nix, I can work on any device, but this one is slow. Especially due to to proot.
2. no services. That is expected, I can't have access to its init system.
3. fs can be flaky. I tried `tar -xf` on a file and it failed with something like `No such file or directory`

I'll probably try rooting the device later to see if that helps with anything. It would sure allow me to avoid proot!
