Gear:
- keyboard: [cantor-remix](https://github.com/nilokr/cantor-remix)
- iem: [chu 2](https://moondroplab.com/en/products/chu-ii)
- some cables

I want a hard case for them.

I've been experimenting with different layout options in [excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com), so far I like this one best because it's pretty compact:
`my website doesn't asset support yet ![[case-layout.svg]]`

And I thought I'd document the whole thing.

I'll start *modelling the body* with the simples shapes, then `boolean modifier` them into what they need to be.

I have completed the middle section housing the keyboard and the iems, now I have to figure out how to close that box. I've been thinking for about half an hour and ran out of ideas. Time to check printables, it seems!

I'm thinking two independent halves with four to six latches like [this one](https://www.printables.com/model/189696-draw-latch) attached on the sides.

Also I want the box to be easily grippable, so I'm making the top and bottom textured

I've messed up the latch mechanism! In order for it to work, one shaft muts be *below* the other. I placed it on below and to the side, so nothing would close if I printed it.

1 hour later, I've made the latches too tight and now I'm not terribly sure how this should be assembled IRL. Ok, I'll make holes in the outer case :/

Now where do I put nuts to hold the screws? Okay, I have a plan, I'll put them in the middle of the inner latch piece.

The model is completed, the only thing left now is to print a few more test slices, tweak the margins and make the final version!

Adjustments:
- [x] change all the screw holes from 3.3 to 3.5 mm
- [x] add the filament saver on the other side of the keyboard

I've printed the bottom half of it. It *does technically work*, but I don't like it. Here's the breakdown:
- not nearly enough space for the wires
- no tools for cable management
- too big and bulky
- keyboard is slow to fit, need to precisely align it

Back to the drawing board!

Pausing the project indefinitely.

Also I just realized that you're reading this without the context of the 3d model because I didn't end up uploading it, so... Sorry...

You know what, I'm excluding this project from the public scope for now. It's going right into inbox. Well, the source note is, these are still accessible. If you're reading this, then you're either on github or I have restored the project. I *want* to restore the project. Not now though. *Eventually*

Oh no wait, I'll leave it public. Nothing links to it anyway. I've creted a new note to remind myself though.
