*Signing* ensures that the *file you got is the same* that its author created (and it *hasn't been modified* since being signed).

You sign a file with your private key:
```shell
> gpg --outupt ./file-signed.sig --sign ./file # sign and compress
> gpg --clearsign ./file # sign and leave in plaintext
> gpg --outupt ./signature.sig --sign ./file # signature as a separate file
```

And verify it using a public key:
```shell
> gpg --verify ./file-signed.sig # check and exit
> gpg --verify ./file-signed.sig ./file # if the signature is detached, you need to verify both the file and the signature$
> gpg --output ./file --decrypt ./file-signed.sig # decompress and decrypt
```
