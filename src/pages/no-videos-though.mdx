I've fixed the previous error, added the No Boilerplate feed, ran the app. It errored out.

Turns out it's not that simple to download things from youtube.

Let's pray that [yt-dlp](/yt-dlp) is written in rust and has a library.

\*checks\*

\*dies\*

And things like youtube-cli are wrappers on top of yt-dlp, so that doesn't help either. I don't want this project to have any system-level dependencies!
