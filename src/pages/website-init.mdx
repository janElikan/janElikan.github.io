I've wanted to *build a website* for a few months now. I am writing this down *now* to finally get it out of my head.

The website will be built from *this* [obsidian](/obsidian) vault, which uses [zettelkasten](/zettelkasten). Viewing source notes by clicking every link is not very browser-friendly imo, so what I want to do is to *render notes as threads*:
- each main note gets a link, and
- their contents get copied into the source notes, separated by `---`.

I'm not aware of any system that can do this, so I'll write my own - taking in obsidian-flavoured [markdown](/markdown) and linking it as described above, outputing as markdown once again.

Then run that through any [ssg](/ssg).
