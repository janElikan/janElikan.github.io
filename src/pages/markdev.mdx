creates and manages [zellij](zellij) workspaces from [obsidian](obsidian) notes.

(insert-video-demo-here)

You can *run* it without installation using `zellij --whatever-the-flags` or *install* it like this: `figure-it-out`.

Example project metdata:
```yaml
# this goes into frontmatter, YAML and TOML are supported

workdir: "~/projects/markdev"
branch: "main" # optional
# no -- editor: "nvim" # manual overwrite
procs:
- bacon
- lazygit

# other fields are ignored
```

If the repo doesn't exist, it will create one.
If the branch doesn't exist, it will ask you what to do.
If the repo is a bare repo, it will know what to do.

Note that markdev creates a *tab* for each project, not a session.

- mutable is fine here
