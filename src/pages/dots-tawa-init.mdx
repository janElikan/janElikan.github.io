Currently, the device that will become <span class="sitelen-pona">ilo&sona tawa</span> is running LineageOS 21 with no root and no gapps. I'll create a separate user on it to test the concept, then probably format it.

I'll start with the terminal, which it must have as it's a general-purpose computer. There's a project called [nix-on-droid](/nix-on-droid), which I'll try now.

Then I want to see if it can manage system-level APKs.

P.S. No, it can only run as a primary user, so I have to do everything on the current account \*sigh\*.
