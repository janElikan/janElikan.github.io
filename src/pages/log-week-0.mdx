I've been reading the [leptos](/leptos) docs and... I might want to try [dioxius](/dioxius). Having to manually memoize everything is fine, I'm used to that after [react](/react). Having to forward signals in every loop is also something I can easily deal with. But the "prop vs attribute" and the view macro syntax make me feel like I'm in the javascript ecosystem.

But it's rust, and I think it shouldn't directly mimic everything js does. I think it has the opportunity to simplify the DX.

Anyway, I've [heared from CodeToTheMoon](https://youtu.be/tq3-M7QJiWg) that dioxius has a nicer looking render macro and a VDom. Initially, I was kinda skeptical about the VDom, but then react is fine so who cares. And dioxius is probably more performant than react in any case.

So I'm gonna give that a go now.

I've also been thinking about the UI design of the app. I've *made a mockup* [here](/lipu-mockup). I want to make this site and my apps feel like one coherent app. It currently looks like spagetti, but that's kind of the point, this is just a quick prototype.
