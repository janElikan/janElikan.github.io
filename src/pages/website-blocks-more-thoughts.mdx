But how are blocks even structured?
- Text blocks can contain other blocks
- Code blocks and links cannot contain other blocks

It seems, therefore, that to process the entire document, I'd have to get the highest block, form a list of sub-blocks, go over every text block inside it and do the same recursively until I get one text block back. *How hard could that be!*

Wait, I'm overcomplicating things. I needed blocks just to replace links, that's simpler to do with a regex...

This is why there's no commit today
