You will need something source to get toolchain, [fenix](/fenix) is recommended:
```nix
inputs.fenix.url = "github:nix-community/fenix";
```

Then overwrite the toolchains:
```nix
let
toolchain = with fenix.packages.${system}; combine [
  minimal.rustc
  minimal.cargo
  targets.x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.latest.rust-std
];

builder = naersk.lib.${system}.override {
  cargo = toolchain;
  rustc = toolchain;
};
```

and then call the build function on `builder`:
```
in rec {
  defaultPackage = naersk'.buildPackage {
    src = ./.;
    doCheck = true;
    nativeBuildInputs = with pkgs; [ pkgsStatic.stdenv.cc ];

    # Tells Cargo that we're building for musl.
    # (https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html#buildtarget)
    CARGO_BUILD_TARGET = "x86_64-unknown-linux-musl";

    # Tells Cargo to enable static compilation.
    # Note that the resulting binary might still be considered dynamically
    # linked by ldd
    # (see: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/79624#issuecomment-737415388)
    CARGO_BUILD_RUSTFLAGS = "-C target-feature=+crt-static";
  };
}
```
