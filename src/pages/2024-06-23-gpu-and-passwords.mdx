I finally got sick enough of Nvidia to get a new GPU. It's an rx570-8g.

The first thing I did is I went and set up [sway](sway) because I wanted to do that for quite a while now. I've done that on my host OS, so it's not in the repo.

2024-06-24 I plan to install [dots](dots) on bare metal. I will need to do a few things today for that to work, though:
- back up the obsidian vault, the work repo and the current config,
- make [dots](dots)' passwords persistent, so it doesn't reset to `hunter2` on every reboot
- write an install guide

Starting with the password, I thought the best way to do that was to make `passwd` and `shadow` persistent, but that doesn't seem to work. I looked it up and it seems many people use `initialHashedPassword`. I don't know if it's a good idea, but my machine should only really ask a password if you already have physical access to it, which you probably don't.
