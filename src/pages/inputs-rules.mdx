(note to self)

*Use an allow-list* instead of blocking everything one-by-one. I can't stress that enough.

*Filtering inputs is important.* Decide what you want to up to date with and set up one or multiple *inbox*es.

*Do not use notifications.* Notifications are for emergencies only. Instead, *check the inbox regularly*, decide what needs your attention and clear the rest.
