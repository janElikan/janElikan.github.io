A VM is basically a computer running inside of another computer.

The physical machine is called the *host*, VM - the *guest*. Multiple guests can be run on one host.

You install a [hypervisor](/hypervisor) on the host, it grabs a chunk of your CPU, memory, disk, etc. and uses that to run a *full operating system* (with a [kernel](/kernel) and an [init-system](/init-system)) on.

Before installing a hypervisor, make sure to enable virtualization support in your UEFI, that massively improves the performance.

Resources are *allocated before booting* the guest, and can not be re-defined at runtime. Same as with a physical computer, really.

VMs are commonly used on servers. For example, if you wanted to deploy a website, you could rent a [vps](/vps) (Virtual Private Server), which is a VM.
