About every half a year I get someone asking me to connect a few old hard drives to the network and they don't want to buy anything and they don't want redundancy. I've built like 3 using Alpine linux, which is nice and light, but also very manual.

Going to fork the dots repo and make a machine template that automatically mounts all drives and samba-shares them. No UI, no RAID support no nothing. Just that. Stupid simple. No install either, just a live USB.

I'll test it in a [virtual-machine](/virtual-machine) (why would I ever build hardware when [machines](/device-vs-machine) are portable and I can borrow hardware from an existing device)
