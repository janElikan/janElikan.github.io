I *don't love how cards look*, probably gonna get rid of them in a few days.

Also, while I remember, the plan is to eventually *scrape* the website that an article is coming from *if it's allowed* by its `robots.txt`.

I should *tweak the backend* so that if an *item disappears* from the feed (Xe's feed is just the last 10 articles, for example), it should be *kept on the device*.

And the back button doesn't work on mobile because it's a single-page app and I don't catch that event.

And add the zoom for images.
