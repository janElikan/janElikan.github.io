After some more ~~googling~~ (duckduckgoing?) I have found the [rusty_ytdl](/rusty_ytdl) crate. I've not found it the first time because it's just a library, with no front-end ~~or apparently I'm just blind~~.

Anyway, I think it's *worth implementing both* because youtube may break something on their end, rendering the [rusty_ytdl](/rusty_ytdl) useless.

Though it makes sense to *start with the [option 0](/no-videos-solution-0)* because it's more lightweight.
