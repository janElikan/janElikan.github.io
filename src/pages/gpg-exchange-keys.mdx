To communicate with someone you have to give them your public key, that can be done using
```shell
> gpg --list-keys # to get the email
> gpg --armor --export <email>
```

The `--armor` flag is used to output ASCII instead of raw bits.

Then they add it with
```shell
> gpg --import key.gpg
> gpg --edit-key <imported-email>
gpg> fpr
# it returns a fingerprint, ask the person you're getting the key from if it matches, then:
gpg> sign
```
