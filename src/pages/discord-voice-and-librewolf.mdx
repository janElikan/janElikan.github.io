Turns out it works if you either
1. use an extension that connects a pipewire node to webrtc, or
2. enable `resistFingerprinting`, rendering Discord unable to select inputs and outputs on its own and break itself

If you have any other ideas on how to do that, please tell me! Any ideas, hacks count!
