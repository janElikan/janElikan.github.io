I come from DEs, so I'm not very used being able to jump to a specific workspace instead of scrolling through them.

Anyway, here's my current setup:
- 1 for audio/video configuration
- 4 for ad-hoc terminal tasks
- 5 is the main workspace, has obsidian at all times and will *usually* have a terminal
- 6 for firefox
- 10 for a windows VM
