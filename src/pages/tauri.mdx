Tauri is a *cross-platform GUI* framework that uses [html](/html), [css](/css) and [javascript](/javascript) as a frontend and [rust](/rust) as a backend.

What makes it *different* from something like [electron](/electron) is that it *uses system webview* instead of depending on chromium.

As a result,
- The apps are small
- It *feels fast*

Launching the application brings up the *core process*, it's the part you wrote in *rust* plus `tao` for creating windows and `wry` for talking to the webview.

Each *webview is* a separate *process* on top of the core.

The *core* process is the only one that has *access to the OS*.

The *processes* have two ways of *communicating* with each other:
- *events*, can be emitted by both the core and the webview
- *commands*, called from the webview and work in much the same way as browser's `fetch`. The request is serialized into json, sent to the server, and then the server responds.

Install the [system deps](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/#system-dependencies). If you're on [nixos](/nixos), they have [a flake example](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites/#1-system-dependencies), which I have tweaked and will post on 2024-08-10 as a github gist.

```shell
> npm create tauri-app@latest -- --rc
> cd <name>
> npm install
> npm run tauri android init
> npm run tauri dev
# or npm run tauri android dev
```
