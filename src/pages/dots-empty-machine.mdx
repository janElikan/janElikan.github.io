I've set up the machine and installed neovim on it. This note will be uploaded after the config, but the dates in the frontmatter are correct.

~~Tomorrow~~ On 2024-06-18 I'll start writing the actual dotfiles.

The machine set up using [quickemu](/quickemu), it's in `~/vms/nixos-unstable-gnome.conf` although it doesn't use gnome. I'll probably rename it later.
