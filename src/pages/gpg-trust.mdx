By default, only the keys that you signed (see [gpg-exchange-keys](/gpg-exchange-keys)) are considered valid. If you *trust* someone, you can run the following command on their key. This will make gpg consider *keys that THEY have signed* automatically *valid*.

```shell
> gpg --edit-key <email>
gpg> trust
```
