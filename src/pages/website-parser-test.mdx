So I ended up needing to have to split the markdown into a not-quite-ast to ignore code blocks properly. I need a file to test it on, so here we are:
```rust
fn main() {
    let path = "/nix/persist/active-externalism/data/website-parser-test.md";
    let note = read_note(path).expect("it's this note!");

    dbg!(note);
}
```
Did you notice here that the note lives under `active-externalism/data` and not just `active-externalism`? Well, that's because `active-externalism` (previously called `~/brain`) is the first, older generation of my vault that didn't use [zettelkasten](zettelkasten).

It seems that the parser will need to be a recursive function.

Also, here's a link to [the tool I use to write this](obsidian) in order to validate named links.
