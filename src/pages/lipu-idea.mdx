I want a single app that would replace newpipe, antennapod and an rss reader. So basically an *RSS reader*/downloader plus *video/audio player*.

Initially I wanted to build it for Android, but I also want it to work on my computer, so I'll use a cross-platform framework.

It must be local-first, everything gets downloaded, everything works offline.
