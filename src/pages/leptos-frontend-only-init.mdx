You'll need `trunk`, it's in nixpkgs and on crates.io, that's the build thingy, and a nightly rust toolchain, which I installed with [fenix](/fenix).

Then you `cargo add leptos --features=csr,nightly` and create an `index.html` in the root of your project (not `src/`, the root!) with an empty head & body.

Use `trunk server --open` to run.
