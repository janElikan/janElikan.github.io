*First test done*! A few things to note:
- since I ended up replacing links with a simple regex, links inside of code blocks are also replaced
- main notes nested inside `source` notes loose their metadata
- in fact, everything looses its metadata

In general, this is a success. Too bad it took (checking) 4 days. But then I'm still learning and I didn't allocate much time for this.

Yeah days are not very useful, let me check the seconds

(reading)

(calculating)

16500 seconds, which is more than 255 minutes

Alright, I'll go add metadata, also write a doc test for it because that seems both simple and a good thing to do.
