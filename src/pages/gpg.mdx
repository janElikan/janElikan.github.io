*Public key criptography* is when you have a public key and a private key. The private key must be kept secret. The public key can be given to anyone you want to communicate with.

The *public key* is used to *encrypt* documents, private - to *decrypt*.

```shell
> gpg --gen-key
# It will ask for the passphrase, it is used to protect your private key if it ever leaks.

# This can be used to revoke the public key if the private key gets compromised
> gpg --output revoke.asc --gen-revoke <email>
```

To communicate with someone you have to give them your public key, that can be done using
```shell
> gpg --list-keys # to get the email
> gpg --armor --export <email>
```

The `--armor` flag is used to output ASCII instead of raw bits.

Then they add it with
```shell
> gpg --import key.gpg
> gpg --edit-key <imported-email>
gpg> fpr
# it returns a fingerprint, ask the person you're getting the key from if it matches, then:
gpg> sign
```

```shell
> gpg --output msg.gpg --encrypt --recipient <email> ./file
```

Note that you can't decrypt it back because you don't have their private key.

is used to secure a file with a passphrase, without using [public-key-cryptography](/public-key-cryptography). It is obviously less secure.

```shell
> gpg --output file.gpg --symmetric ./file
Enter passphrase:
```

*Signing* ensures that the *file you got is the same* that its author created (and it *hasn't been modified* since being signed).

You sign a file with your private key:
```shell
> gpg --outupt ./file-signed.sig --sign ./file # sign and compress
> gpg --clearsign ./file # sign and leave in plaintext
> gpg --outupt ./signature.sig --sign ./file # signature as a separate file
```

And verify it using a public key:
```shell
> gpg --verify ./file-signed.sig # check and exit
> gpg --verify ./file-signed.sig ./file # if the signature is detached, you need to verify both the file and the signature$
> gpg --output ./file --decrypt ./file-signed.sig # decompress and decrypt
```

<NoteMeta name="gpg-trust" source="" scope="public" type="main" created="2024-07-20T12:43Z" modified="2024-07-20T12:49Z" />

By default, only the keys that you signed (see [gpg-exchange-keys](/gpg-exchange-keys)) are considered valid. If you *trust* someone, you can run the following command on their key. This will make gpg consider *keys that THEY have signed* automatically *valid*.

```shell
> gpg --edit-key <email>
gpg> trust
```

A good passphrase is crucial. Trying to brute force it is uneffective, so the attacker would probably try to guess it.

In addition, the handbook recommends *storing a key on a physical, removable, write-protected* device. This is not always an option, but it's good if you can do that.
