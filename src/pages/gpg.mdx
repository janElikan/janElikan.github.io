*Public key criptography* is when you have a public key and a private key. The private key must be kept secret. The public key can be given to anyone you want to communicate with.

The *public key* is used to *encrypt* documents, private - to *decrypt*.

```shell
> gpg --gen-key
# It will ask for the passphrase, it is used to protect your private key if it ever leaks.

# This can be used to revoke the public key if the private key gets compromised
> gpg --output revoke.asc --gen-revoke <email>
```

To communicate with someone you have to give them your public key, that can be done using
```shell
> gpg --list-keys # to get the email
> gpg --armor --export <email>
```

The `--armor` flag is used to output ASCII instead of raw bits.

Then they add it with
```shell
> gpg --import key.gpg
> gpg --edit-key <imported-email>
gpg> fpr
# it returns a fingerprint, ask the person you're getting the key from if it matches, then:
gpg> sign
```

```shell
> gpg --output msg.gpg --encrypt --recipient <email> ./file
```

Note that you can't decrypt it back because you don't have their private key.

is used to secure a file with a passphrase, without using [public-key-cryptography](/public-key-cryptography). It is obviously less secure.

```shell
> gpg --output file.gpg --symmetric ./file
Enter passphrase:
```
