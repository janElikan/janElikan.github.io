I think I want to give sway another go.

*Reasons*:
- my gnome shortcuts are not configured declaratively
- there are a few apps that I don't want
- I want complete control and configurability of my system
- I want custom launchers
- the tiling addon is not the best thing ever
- not lightweight enough to run a desktop version *on a raspberry pi off a solar panel* (I do own a pi 3b+).
- *my system works too well and I'm bored /lh*
