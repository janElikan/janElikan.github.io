Alright but how *do* I get the different blocks of the website? I have tried splitting the text on triple \` and labelling every other one as code, but that has 2 problems:
- escaping
- depth

Let me outline the task again: I need to turn a `String` into a sequence of `Block`s.

Option two is making a loop, going through each character, comparing them against the markdown syntax (if the last one is not a backslash) and filling a temporary buffer with characters like these until there's a closing one. I don't know if that sentence makes much sense, I'm not re-reading it, I'll go try that approach instead.

Or here's what I want: split the string into more strings, every other one is a delimiter, and then assemble blocks of three into blocks. There.

Okay, I'm done. *TIL: match_indices and zip functions exist*.
