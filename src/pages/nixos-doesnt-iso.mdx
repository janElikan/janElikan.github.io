I've built an ISO and it doesn't do what I intended. I can't find the smb service anywhere and autofs is not configured properly. The hostname is right though. I'll look into it.

So my problems are coming from [the installer module](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/nixos/modules/installer/cd-dvd/installation-cd-minimal.nix), I'll make a system without it now.

Nope, I'm not, a lot of things depend on it.

Turns out the *disk manager service* [was disabled](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/nixos/modules/profiles/minimal.nix)!
