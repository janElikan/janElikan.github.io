How should I *store passwords*?

I use gpg with gnu pass, so that's easy. But how do I back them up? I currently have 2 copies of the private key: on <span class="sitelen-pona">ilo&sona suli</span> and <span class="sitelen-pona">ilo&sona tawa</span>. But what if I loose both? What of the off-site backup? Good that I will have the data, but *I won't be able to recover it*!
