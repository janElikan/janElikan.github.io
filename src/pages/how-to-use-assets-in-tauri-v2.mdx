Yay, I have finally figured it out [.ui](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Lojban/Attitudinals#Simple_pure_emotions:)

They didn't document this properly, [leaving links](https://v2.tauri.app/reference/javascript/api/namespacecore/#convertfilesrc) to [v1](https://tauri.app/v1/api/config/#allowlistconfig.protocol), which is half outdated, but here's the *patch* for `tauri.conf.json` that is needed *to make assets from appdata work*:
```json
{
  "app": {
      "security": {
          "csp": "default-src 'self' ipc: http://ipc.localhost; img-src 'self' asset: http://asset.localhost",
          "assetProtocol": {
              "enable": true,
              "scope": ["$APPDATA/**"]
          }
      }
  }
}
```
