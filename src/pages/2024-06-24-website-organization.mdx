First, I have to figure out how to structure it. Right now I have a somewhat pure [zettelkasten](/zettelkasten) system with *main* notes and *source* notes. Normally, source notes would be converted into folders. But that comes with the limitation of being unable to source a single note in multiple places. So I'll leave the directory structure flat, as it is now.

I thought of making my own SSG, but that'd be quite unnecessary. So instead I should make something closer to [obsidian-export](https://github.com/zoni/obsidian-export), but
- with MDX support,
- built-in linking
- custom code blocks

And then build that using... Probably [astro](/astro) for its ecosystem (I like [tailwind](/tailwind), for instance).
