I want a single app that would replace newpipe, antennapod and an rss reader. So basically an *RSS reader*/downloader plus *video/audio player*.

Initially I wanted to build it for Android, but I also want it to work on my computer, so I'll use a cross-platform framework.

It must be local-first, everything gets downloaded, everything works offline.

The [first month](/lipu-old-devlog) was spent writing the *minimal logic* and trying to make *bindings* from it to [tauri](/tauri). This has failed, as tauri had some unexpected issues.

I decided to start again with [leptos](/leptos). Leptos has a *different data flow* model, and the frontend now has to be *running in a browser* instead of being an app. This requires more changes.

So I'm restarting the entire project, from scratch.

I've also made some changes to how I'm writing about it. Instead of publishing the raw notes, most of which are tasks, I'll *work for a week* and *then publish* the results. The commits in the repo are also not gonna be daily (for example, today I'll be reading the leptos book).

I've been reading the [leptos](/leptos) docs and... I might want to try [dioxius](/dioxius). Having to manually memoize everything is fine, I'm used to that after [react](/react). Having to forward signals in every loop is also something I can easily deal with. But the "prop vs attribute" and the view macro syntax make me feel like I'm in the javascript ecosystem.

But it's rust, and I think it shouldn't directly mimic everything js does. I think it has the opportunity to simplify the DX.

Anyway, I've [heared from CodeToTheMoon](https://youtu.be/tq3-M7QJiWg) that dioxius has a nicer looking render macro and a VDom. Initially, I was kinda skeptical about the VDom, but then react is fine so who cares. And dioxius is probably more performant than react in any case.

So I'm gonna give that a go now.

I've also been thinking about the UI design of the app. I've *made a mockup* [here](/lipu-mockup). I want to make this site and my apps feel like one coherent app. It currently looks like spagetti, but that's kind of the point, this is just a quick prototype.
