I want a single app that would replace newpipe, antennapod and an rss reader. So basically an *RSS reader*/downloader plus *video/audio player*.

Initially I wanted to build it for Android, but I also want it to work on my computer, so I'll use a cross-platform framework.

It must be local-first, everything gets downloaded, everything works offline.

I *wanted an RSS reader*, *miniflux* looks like a good option, but it's unnecesserally *complicated* for my use-case, it has a server and a client and I *don't want/need a server*. Plus it's *fun to build* things!

The *first version* will be just a *CLI*, to test out the idea.

Then it needs a *frontend*, I think [tauri](/tauri) looks good.

Then it needs ompl support and, as it turns out, youtube downloads.

<NoteMeta name="rust-rss-crate" source="https://docs.rs/rss/latest/rss/" scope="public" type="main" created="2024-08-05T16:03Z" modified="2024-08-07T13:48Z" />

A crate for reading/*creating* rss feeds. See [feed-rs](/feed-rs) as well.
```shell
> cargo add rss
```
```rust
use rss::Channel;
use rss::ChannelBuilder;

fn read() -> Channel {
    let file = std::fs::File::open("feed.xml").unwrap();
    let buffer = std::io::BufReader::new(file);
    Channel::read_from(buffer).unwrap()
}

fn create() -> Channel {
    ChannelBuilder::default()
        .title("Example feed")
        .link("http://example.com/feed")
        .description("Test feed")
        .build()
}
```

Channel has its metadata and `items`:
```rust
struct Item {
    title: Option<String>,
    link: Option<String>,
    description: Option<String>,
    author: Option<String>,
    categories: Vec<Category>,
    comments: Option<String>,
    /// The description of a media object that is attached to the item.
    enclosure: Option<Enclosure>,
    guid: Option<Guid>,
    pub_date: Option<String>,
    /// The RSS channel the item came from.
    source: Option<Source>,
    /// The HTML contents of the item.
    content: Option<String>,
    extensions: ExtensionMap,
    atom_ext: Option<atom::AtomExtension>,
    itunes_ext: Option<itunes::ITunesItemExtension>,
    // some fields omitted
}
```

Today I want to make a functioning prototype in the CLI.

*reqwest* is the rust's most popular HTTP client:
```toml
# add to Cargo.toml
reqwest = {
    version = "0.12.5",
    features = ["rustls-tls", "json"], # don't use OS's openssl
    default-features = false,
}
```
```rust
let body = reqwest::get("https://example.com")
    .await?
    .text()
    .await()?;

let response = reqwest::Client::new()
    .post("http://httpbin.org/post")
    .json(&some_hashmap_here)
    .send()
    .await?;
```

<NoteMeta name="lipu-oopsie" source="" scope="public" type="main" created="2024-08-07T13:49Z" modified="2024-08-07T13:52Z" />

I've tried to use the [rust-rss-crate](/rust-rss-crate) for the project because it's the only one I've heared of. Everything worked fine until I *tried adding more feeds*. I tested it with [fasterthanlime's feed](https://fasterthanli.me/index.xml) and [namtao's youtube feed](https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCMHZ1P2iYimObhtHKfPz7gw). The library complained that the feeds didn't have a correct rss version.

So now I'm rewriting the entire thing (which is thankfully very small, so it's not a big deal) to use [feed-rs](/feed-rs).

<NoteMeta name="feed-rs" source="https://docs.rs/feed-rs/2.1.0/feed_rs/index.html" scope="public" type="main" created="2024-08-07T12:50Z" modified="2024-08-07T13:49Z" />

A crate for reading rss, atom, json feeds.

It has much more *comprehensive types* and supports more formats than the [rust-rss-crate](/rust-rss-crate).

```rust
let feed = parser::parse(xml.as_bytes()).unwrap();
```

<NoteMeta name="no-videos-though" source="" scope="public" type="main" created="2024-08-07T14:13Z" modified="2024-08-07T14:19Z" />

I've fixed the previous error, added the No Boilerplate feed, ran the app. It errored out.

Turns out it's not that simple to download things from youtube.

Let's pray that [yt-dlp](/yt-dlp) is written in rust and has a library.

\*checks\*

\*dies\*

And things like youtube-cli are wrappers on top of yt-dlp, so that doesn't help either. I don't want this project to have any system-level dependencies!

<NoteMeta name="no-videos-solution-0" source="" scope="public" type="main" created="2024-08-07T14:18Z" modified="2024-08-07T14:21Z" />

I've just realized that I can use iframes. So the simplest, *dumbest solution that will work* is to add an *ArticleBody::YouTube* enum variant, have it be a link and read it in the front-end.

---

<NoteMeta name="no-videos-solution-1" source="" scope="public" type="main" created="2024-08-07T14:22Z" modified="2024-08-08T08:19Z" />

After some more ~~googling~~ (duckduckgoing?) I have found the [rusty_ytdl](/rusty_ytdl) crate. I've not found it the first time because it's just a library, with no front-end ~~or apparently I'm just blind~~.

Anyway, I think it's *worth implementing both* because youtube may break something on their end, rendering the [rusty_ytdl](/rusty_ytdl) useless.

Though it makes sense to *start with the [option 0](/no-videos-solution-0)* because it's more lightweight.

<NoteMeta name="lipu-library" source="" scope="public" type="main" created="2024-08-08T07:55Z" modified="2024-08-08T08:03Z" />

The logic part of [lipu](/lipu), rss reader back-end.

Usage:
```rust
use lipu::App;

// App is just a builder to get Vec<Article>
let app: App = App::new().add_feed("https://fasterthanli.me/index.xml");
let articles: Vec<Article> = app.fetch().await;
```

A [CLI app exmaple](https://github.com/janElikan/lipu/blob/main/src/main.rs).

Types:
```rust
pub struct Article {
    pub id: String,
    pub name: String,
    pub source: Option<String>,
    pub description: Option<String>,
    pub body: ArticleBody,
    pub created: Option<DateTime<Utc>>,
    pub updated: Option<DateTime<Utc>>,
    pub viewed: Progress,
}

pub enum ArticleBody {
    Text(String),
    Video(MediaPayload),
    Audio(MediaPayload),
    YouTubeLink(String),
}

pub enum Progress {
    None,
    UntilLine(usize),
    UntilSecond(usize),
    Fully,
}

pub struct MediaPayload {
    pub url: String,
    pub mime_type: String,
    pub downloaded: bool,
}
```

Tauri is a *cross-platform GUI* framework that uses [html](/html), [css](/css) and [javascript](/javascript) as a frontend and [rust](/rust) as a backend.

What makes it *different* from something like [electron](/electron) is that it *uses system webview* instead of depending on chromium.

As a result,
- The apps are small
- It *feels fast*

Install the [system deps](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/#system-dependencies). If you're on [nixos](/nixos), I have [made a flake](https://gist.github.com/janElikan/1a0d66b7f059387e44ba232b79af7450).

```shell
> npm create tauri-app@latest -- --rc
> cd <name>
> npm install
> npm run tauri android init
> npm run tauri dev
# or npm run tauri android dev
```

When using git, you *should commit* `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock` and, if you are using, them `flake.nix` and `flake.lock`.

Victory indeed, considering that I've spent the last 128 minutes trying to get it to work!

oh wait, I forgot something:
```
Please set the JAVA_HOME variable in your environment to match the
location of your Java installation.

    Error Failed to assemble APK: command ["/nix/persist/repos/tauri-playground/tauri-app/src-tauri/gen/android/gradlew", "--project-dir", "/nix/persist/repos/tauri-playground/tauri-app/src-tauri/gen/android"] exited with code 1: command ["/nix/persist/repos/tauri-playground/tauri-app/src-tauri/gen/android/gradlew", "--project-dir", "/nix/persist/repos/tauri-playground/tauri-app/src-tauri/gen/android"] exited with code 1
```

Fixed that, ran it again and now it hang. I think it's okay, that's probably gradle being slow (?)

I'm not very good with ~~plants~~ android and java tooling.

```
