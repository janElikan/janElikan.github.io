I want a single app that would replace newpipe, antennapod and an rss reader. So basically an *RSS reader*/downloader plus *video/audio player*.

Initially I wanted to build it for Android, but I also want it to work on my computer, so I'll use a cross-platform framework.

It must be local-first, everything gets downloaded, everything works offline.

I *wanted an RSS reader*, *miniflux* looks like a good option, but it's unnecesserally *complicated* for my use-case, it has a server and a client and I *don't want/need a server*. Plus it's *fun to build* things!

The *first version* will be just a *CLI*, to test out the idea.

Then it needs a *frontend*, I think [tauri](/tauri) looks good.
