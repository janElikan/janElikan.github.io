I just want a working version and that's going extremely slow now. To make an app, I have to figure out tauri.

*But.*

But. If I drop the requirement of offline media for now, I could wrap the lipu-library in a wasm library and make a web version and then put it on this website. That'd be faster, I'm way more familiar with those things. That would break the contract, so it'd be a v1.0. Then I could write a new wrapper for, say, android, to bring back the offline thing.
