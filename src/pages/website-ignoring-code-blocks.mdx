(mobile note)

To ignore code blocks when transforming links:
```rust-pseudocode
text.split('`')
  .enumerate()
  .map(if % 2==0 { replace_links() })
  .join('`');
```

(mobile note end)

fixed the bug, testing:

Here's a link to [zettelkasten](zettelkasten), for example.

`Here's the same link, but inside a code block: [[zettelkasten]]`

```markdown
And here's a multiline code block with the same link:
[[zettelkasten]]
```

Yeah, it works.

While I'm at it, I may as well fix the line breaks. When the tool is filling in a source note with main notes that it links to, it inserts a `---` after each one. Including the last one.
