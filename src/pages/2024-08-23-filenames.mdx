I do really love rust a lot. Especially in contrast to typescript. The *compiler is so much more helpful!* And the standard library's function names make so much sense!

For instance, I realized that I tried to use the raw ID of each resource, which can contain a full url with all the slashes and whatnot, as a filename and the system couldn't create anything because of that. Here's what the solution ended up being:
```rust
let filename: String = item.metadata.id
  .chars()
  .filter(|char| char.is_ascii_alphanumeric())
  .collect();
```

Tauri is funny though: I have ran the app, told it to download something and it restarted. Turns out writing anything into `./` means writing into `src-tauri/` and writing into `src-tauri/` triggers a reload.
