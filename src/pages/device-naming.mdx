My *naming scheme* before february 2024 was non-existant. My computer was running pop os, so it was called `ryzen5-pop`. My phone used whatever name the manufacturer gave it.

Then I switched to `LLSSSRRRI`:

| hostname  | Location | System       | Role       | Index | type         |
| --------- | -------- | ------------ | ---------- | ----- | ------------ |
| honixdev0 | *ho*me   | *nix*os      | *dev*box   | 0     | workstation  |
| hodebsrv0 | *ho*me   | *deb*ian     | *s*e*rv*er | 0     | raspberry pi |
| molincli0 | *mo*bile | *lin*eage os | *cli*ent   | 0     | phone        |

But that's a bit extra, considering that at most I will have 3 devices (as stated in [dots-rules](/dots-rules)).

So currently I renamed
- `honixdev0` to `suli`, as in `big computer`
- `molincli0` to `tawa`, as in `portable computer`

Also more on `molincli0`, it was planned to be an ssh client, but now it's a standalone machine, so it'd be wrong to call it `cli0` anymore.
