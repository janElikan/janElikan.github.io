I keep having problems with this. I *really* want to use the [typestate-pattern](/typestate-pattern) here for intitialization, it would make sense. But I can't either because of how the [zellij-plugins](/zellij-plugins) API is implemented or because I don't understand how to work with it. Anyway, ~~tomorrow~~ 2024-06-21 I'll remove all the plugin code and make it a standalone tool first. Then see if it makes sense to wrap it in a plugin again.
