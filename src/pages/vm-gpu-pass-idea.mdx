So I wanted to try GPU pass-through for a long time now, but have never HAD a GPU to do it with. If I understand correctly, this would've been possible if my CPU had integrated graphics, but it's a `ryzen 3600`, so no.

But now I've upgraded my GPU and haven't yet sold the old one, so I can try that. Why?
- learn how it works
- see how performant it is
- the uni I'm going to will *probably* want me to use Windows, and I'm not installing that thing on bare metal again!
