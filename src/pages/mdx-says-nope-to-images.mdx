Or, this is how it *would work*, but nope, what I get is:
```text
Expected the closing tag `</text>` either after the end of `paragraph` (130:16) or another opening tag after the start of `paragraph` (130:2)
```

That's because it's formatted like this though:
```xml
	<text x="58.59375" y="19.3125" font-family=
	"Cascadia, Segoe UI Emoji" font-size="20px" fill="#6741d9"
	text-anchor="middle" style="white-space: pre;" direction="ltr"
	dominant-baseline="alphabetic">references</text>
```

So I can probably fix it by parsing the entire thing \*sigh\*

Fine, *I'll do it tomorrowâ„¢*!
