is a system where you create *concise notes* and rely on *links* to build knowledge instead of writing everything in one file.

It's an *append-only* system. If you want to edit a note, you create a new one that links to the old, starting a sort-of conversation.

To keep yourself from making the notes too long, try keeping them 128 English words max.

There are:
1. *Main* notes, explaining single ideas
2. *Source* notes, groups of permanent notes, no data in them
