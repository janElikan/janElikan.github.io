What I omitted above `(cut)` were basically all of my other devices. In IOMMU group 11 there are:
- the SATA adapter through which my OS disk is connected
- the keyboard/mouse USB hub
- the other USB hub
- the ethernet controller
- the audio controller

I ran the script and thought that the system just froze. IT DIDN'T FREEZE! I just disconnected all of the perepherals.

So now I've swapped the GPUs around, now the IOMMU group 12 is JUST the guest GPU.
