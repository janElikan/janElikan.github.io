Created the *website repo*, not the generator. I'll add the content tomorrow, it's not staged for now. I've been working on it locally.

Basic styles down, though I didn't test mobile.
There is no header/footer.

Now going to deploy it with gh pages.

Also I forgot to add the `nasin-nanpa` font :facepalm:
