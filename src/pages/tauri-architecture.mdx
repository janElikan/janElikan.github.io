Launching the application brings up the *core process*, it's the part you wrote in *rust* plus `tao` for creating windows and `wry` for talking to the webview.

Each *webview is* a separate *process* on top of the core.

The *core* process is the only one that has *access to the OS*.

The *processes* have two ways of *communicating* with each other:
- *events*, can be emitted by both the core and the webview
- *commands*, called from the webview and work in much the same way as browser's `fetch`. The request is serialized into json, sent to the server, and then the server responds.
