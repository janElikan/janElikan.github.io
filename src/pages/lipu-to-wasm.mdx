Before I figure out how to do that, I need to clean up the library a bit. Currently it has downloads built-in, I need to drop that.

But after that, the WASM integration still needs some thought. There are two main approaches I could take: using a rust framework or using a js framework. I've never tried not using javascript anywhere (not that you can tell from my github profile, but that's not the point), so I'll stick with the latter for now. I'm also kinda treating this project as a playground for learning, so yeah.

Then there is leptos and dioxus, leptos seems to be more popular, I'll try it first.

(later) It'll take a few days for me to get through the leptos book, brb
