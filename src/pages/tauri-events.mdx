*Events* are designed for exchanging *small data* packets quickly. Their bodies are *json strings*.

Events can be *global* (use `emit`) or webview-specific (read the source of this note).

```rust
use tauri::{AppHandle, Emitter};
use serde::Serialize;

#[derive(Clone, Serialize)]
#[serde(rename_all = "camelCase")]
struct Download<'a> {
  url: &'a str,
}

#[tauri::command]
fn download(app: AppHandle, url: String) {
  // actual download logic

  app.emit("download-finished", Download { url: &url }).unwrap();
}
```
```typescript
import { listen } from '@tauri-apps/api/event';

type Download = {
  url: string;
};

const stop_listening = listen<Download>('download-finished', (event) => {
  console.log(`download from ${event.payload.url} finished`);
});
```

You can also listen to events in rust, check out the source for that.
