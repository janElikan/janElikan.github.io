I've messed up the latch mechanism! In order for it to work, one shaft muts be *below* the other. I placed it on below and to the side, so nothing would close if I printed it.

1 hour later, I've made the latches too tight and now I'm not terribly sure how this should be assembled IRL. Ok, I'll make holes in the outer case :/
