Tauri is a *cross-platform GUI* framework that uses [html](/html), [css](/css) and [javascript](/javascript) as a frontend and [rust](/rust) as a backend.

What makes it *different* from something like [electron](/electron) is that it *uses system webview* instead of depending on chromium.

As a result,
- The apps are small
- It *feels fast*
