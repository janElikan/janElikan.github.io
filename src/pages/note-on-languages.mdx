I've noticed a drastic difference between writing the back-end and the front-end for [lipu](/lipu).

The front-end currently uses [react](/react), I run the app continuously and click around to make sure nothing breaks (it does).

The back-end was written in [rust](/rust), I ran it like twice to make sure the thing does everything I want it to. The rest of the time I just had [cargo-clippy](/cargo-clippy) on the right half of the screen and "talked" to it.

*The rust experience really is nicer.*
