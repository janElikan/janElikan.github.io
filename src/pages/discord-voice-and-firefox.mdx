- Discord likes there to be a physical (or virtual) microphone, it's not very comfortable with other applications feeding their audio into it
- It works in firefox, but I've messed up something in my config
- Also I wanted a clean firefox setup for a while,
- *So I'm switching to librewolf*

I've tried running discord in that, everything worked, then I exited the browser, re-launced it and was pleasantly surprised with my cookies being auto-deleted. I like this browser!
