The [first month](/lipu-old-devlog) was spent writing the *minimal logic* and trying to make *bindings* from it to [tauri](/tauri). This has failed, as tauri had some unexpected issues.

I decided to start again with [leptos](/leptos). Leptos has a *different data flow* model, and the frontend now has to be *running in a browser* instead of being an app. This requires more changes.

So I'm restarting the entire project, from scratch.

I've also made some changes to how I'm writing about it. Instead of publishing the raw notes, most of which are tasks, I'll *work for a week* and *then publish* the results. The commits in the repo are also not gonna be daily (for example, today I'll be reading the leptos book).
