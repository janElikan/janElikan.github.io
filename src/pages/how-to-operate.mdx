## One thing at a time.
Focus on one task. No, journalling is also a task, you can't do that at the same time as something else.

## Most important thing first.
Tasks are managed by the system completely, you have no power to decide what you want to do now. You have the power to decide what a future version of you will be doing in a certain context.

## Start now.
Search by the context and grab the top one.

## Writing it down.
When the tasks are over, you must write down what you've done in that period of time. That is also a task. Don't do it in parallel. Don't copy the task itself, write down the main parts of it. The task list is separate from the logs.

## Mutability.
