What I don't like the most about prototype 0 is the lack of configurability. What happens ~~if~~ when I want to move the vault to a different directory? What happens if I want to add/remove a scope?

I want the utility to be configured using *environment variables* only, and *print the logs to stdout*.

Okay, I've done the output part, I don't like this:
```
 INFO  site_builder > reading source note `gpg`
 INFO  site_builder > inserting `public-key-cryptography` into `gpg`
 INFO  site_builder > inserting `gpg-create-key` into `gpg`
 (etc)
```

I'll make it a tree view instead.

*done*

Now I just have to make a flake package for it!
